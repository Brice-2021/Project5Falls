	<h1> DENVER BRONCOS <h3>3-3 (3rd)<h3> </h1>
	<p> The Denver Broncos started the season on a roll with a record of 3-0. Since the great start they have fell over and lost the last three. Inconsistent defense and increased strength of opponent has derailed their momentum and left with more questions than answers.  </p>
	<h1> KANSAS CITY CHIEFS <h3> 3-3 (4th) </h3></h1>
	<p> Kansas City's sloppy play has hurt their playoff contention. Patrick Mahomes 8 interceptions over the first 6 games have shown glimpses of his collegiate self and not the NFL MVP we've come to expect. This paired with injuries to defensive players like Chris Jones, Frank Clark, Willie Gay, and Tyrann Mathieu have left them struggling at a 3-3 record. Their defense stood strong against a weak Washington team but much improvement is needed to get them back to winning form. </p>
	<h1> LOS ANGELES CHARGERS <h3> 4-2 (1st) </h3></h1>
	<p> The Chargers strong start was halted against the Ravens as they struggled to put up over 6 points in their last game. Despite this last week they still have strong wins over the Football Team, Chiefs, Raiders, and Browns. Key wins over division rivals give them the tiebreaker if the season were to end today. </p>
	<h1> LAS VEGAS RAIDERS <h3> 4-2 (2nd)</h3> </h1>
	<p> Raiders started the season with a great overtime win against the Ravens that helped kick off the football feeling across America. They continued this momentum with wins against Pittsburg and Miami. This stopped with two losses to the Chargers and Bears. Both of these games they failed to score over 14 points. They came back and beat the Broncos despite Jon Gruden being removed from the team. </p>
