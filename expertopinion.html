	<h1> DENVER BRONCOS <h3>6-11<h3> </h1>
	<p> The Denver Broncos made news in the beginning of the season by benching quarterback Drew Lock in favor of Teddy Bridgewater. This worked for the first three games as they started out 3-0. This team did a 180 over the past few weeks and have fallen to 3-3. Lingering injuries to pass rusher and first round pick Bradley Chubb has stinted the Broncos defense which was off to a fiery start. Broncos have 5 regular season games against division oppponents who all have the edge at the moment. We expect them to still pickup wins against the Eagles and Washington, but anything else is going to have to be hard-fought. At this point we believe they could mess up other team's playoffs spotting but they themselves will be out of it. </p>
	<h1> KANSAS CITY CHIEFS <h3>11-6</h3></h1>
	<p> Despite a humbling start we predict the Chiefs to overcome their mistakes and clean up for the rest of the season, guaranteeing a wild card playoff spot. Most of their troubles have come from injuries and turnovers. Without Chris Jones and Frank Clark completely healthy the defense has performed horribly besides last week's win versus Washington. A big scheme change that aided this previous week was the starting of Juan Thornhill over Daniel Sorensen. Beyond defense Patrick Mahomes is on pace to have his most turnovers in a year by a wide-margin. Some have been atrocious while others could not be avoided by Patrick. From here on out we expect a cleaner Chiefs team that will return to their former AFC Championship mentality.  </p>
	<h1> LOS ANGELES CHARGERS <h3>12-5</h3> </h1>
	<p> 2nd year quarterback, Justin Herbert, is looking more and more comfortable in his role of a NFL quarterback and succeeding as a leader. Pairing Herbert with Ekeler has proven to be effective along with the help of Keenan Allen and Mike Williams at receiver. This core is a mix of young and veteran who are hungry to win after falling to the Chiefs in the division over the recent years. They feel they finally have the team capable of challenging Andy Reid and the Chiefs and are proving that thus far. We expect the Chargers to keep this momentum and steal the division title from Kansas City. This will mark the official turning tides of the AFC that puts each team back in contention for the AFC West Champion Title. </p>
	<h1> LAS VEGAS RAIDERS <h3>9-8</h3></h1>
	<p> Las Vegas Raiders season took a swift curve because of Coach Gruden who was allowed to resign from the team due to leaked emails exposing him of racism and homophobia. The Raiders looked strong in their first week without Gruden posting a 34-24 win over Denver, but we expect this to take a bigger toll on the team as the season continues. We believe they'll have a winning record but will either be in the worst seed of the AFC or miss the playoffs completely. Over the years the Raiders have posted winning streaks that gave the team hope while they couldn't pull through in the end of the season. We believe this case will be repeated lingering the question on whether or not quarterback Derek Carr will be the future of the team.   </p>
